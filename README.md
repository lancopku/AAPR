# AAPR
- This code is based on: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03977">Automatic Academic Paper Rating Based on Modularized Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network</a>
- The dataset for the AAPR task is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ttKdXUjaFi3eS6zeHITuZjsTGrh6M4ij
- For the AAPR dataset, you can process the latex source data in your own way (e.g. considering the number of formulas or charts). The script clean_latex.py provides an optional way of initial rough processing.
- If there is any problem, please contact Pengcheng Yang (yang_pc@pku.edu.cn)
